## A first draft

I've had too many personal websites/domains and things to maintain an overview of 'stuff I did'. It's time to bring it all together in one place. Here. Let's see how it goes and if we can bring it all together in a way that workd for me and the public.

### List of things I plan on having here
  - Presentations
  - CV
  - Projects
  - Datasets
  - Blogs ??
  - Conflicts of intrest
  - _Usefull_ `code snippets`




## Placeholders
